# Rock-Paper-Scissor

// What I Learned: 
  - Understand how function parameters and arguments work
  - Using while loops
  - math.random function 
  
// Things I can do in the future: 
  - Better use of conditionals to get all the different types of options rather than using a bunch of them. 
  - Add styles
