# Rock-Paper-Scissor

// What I Learned: 
  - Understand how function parameters and arguments work
  - Using while loops
  - math.random function 
  
// Things I can do in the future: 
  - Better use of conditionals to get all the different types of options rather than using a bunch of them. 
  - Add styles
  
Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)

Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
